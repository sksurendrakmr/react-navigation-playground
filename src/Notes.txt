Installation
===================
step 1 : npm install @react-navigation/native
step 2 : npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

To use Stack Navigator 
npm install @react-navigation/native-stack
===============================================


In react navigation, we have three types of Navigators.
1. Stack Navigator => For taking the user from one screen to another.
2. Tab Navigator => For implementing tab.
3. Drawer Navigator => For implementing drawer that we can pull from left side of the screen.

=================================================================================

Navigating Between screens
=========================
Requirement : On click of view Tweet button, it will navigate to tweet details screen.

React navigation gives our screen component a special prop called navigation.

navigation.navigate() -> make sure that we have a single instance of a route/screen in our stack.
We will have single instance of a screen in the stack.

navigation.push() -> can have multiple instance of a screen in the stack.

The navigation props is only available for the component which is defined in the <Stack.Screen> component.
If we have a child component inside Tweet component then that child component will not 
have the access of navigation props.
But we can use navigation hook to get access of navigation object.

================================================================
Setting Screen Titles
===============================
As we have noticed, the title of the screen is based on the name of the route.
What if we need to change the title??

The Screen component has another props called options which is an object.

What if we wanna set the title dynamically based on the data in the route parameters.
In option props, we can either set it to an object or an function that return an object.

and react navigation automatically inject the route paramater as an argument in option 
function.

=============================================
Customizing Headers
===========================================
headerStyle -> style the header. Take css
headerTintColor -> change the title text color 
headerShown -> boolean (to appear or disappear the header)

If we make this changes inside options object, then it will 
only applied to screen where options props are defined.

To apply them globally, we need to make changes in Navigator.

===============================================


In react navigation, we have three types of Navigators.
1. Stack Navigator => For taking the user from one screen to another.
2. Tab Navigator => For implementing tab.
3. Drawer Navigator => For implementing drawer that we can pull from left side of the screen.

=================================================================================

Navigating Between screens
=========================
Requirement : On click of view Tweet button, it will navigate to tweet details screen.

React navigation gives our screen component a special prop called navigation.

navigation.navigate() -> make sure that we have a single instance of a route/screen in our stack.
We will have single instance of a screen in the stack.

navigation.push() -> can have multiple instance of a screen in the stack.

The navigation props is only available for the component which is defined in the <Stack.Screen> component.
If we have a child component inside Tweet component then that child component will not 
have the access of navigation props.
But we can use navigation hook to get access of navigation object.
